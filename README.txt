Welcome to TFLOW, a command-line pipeline for de novo transcriptome assembly and analysis.

 --- Get Me Started ---
Optional: Add TFLOW dir to your path with: "export PATH=[TFLOW_DIR]:$PATH"
Optional: Add TFLOW dir to your python path with: "export PYTHONPATH=[TFLOW_DIR]:$PYTHONPATH"
(Replacing [TFLOW_DIR] with absolute path to TFLOW Directory Location)

Run: "[TFLOW_DIR]/test_TFLOW_setup.sh"
(Equivalent to "[TFLOW_DIR]/tflow.sh test -t Test_Pipe")

Then, for each component that can't be found:
    Install (if not already)
    in TFLOW_Local_Settings.dat:
        set [UTILITY]_LOCATION variable with executable conatining folder
        OR: set [UTILITY]_EXEC variable of full executable path

When every component (that you care about) reports "Found!":
    Create a project directory
    Copy desired pipe options file template to project directory:
        Ex: Copy options.dat.Trinity_Pipe_Template to My_Project/options.dat)
    Set mandatory and suggested settings in options file:
        Ex: is_paired_reads <True/False>
            label           <tissue_name>
            BUSCO_type      <vertebrata>
    Run:
        Ex: "[TFLOW_DIR]/tflow.sh run --raw_reads MyData/*.gz"
        OR: "[TFLOW_DIR]/tflow.sh run --raw_left_reads MyData/*left_reads*.gz --raw_right_reads MyData/*right_reads*.gz"
	(Template Job Submission Scripts Included for Each Pipe Type)

    Then, See what's going on in the job by running:
        "[TFLOW_DIR]/tflow.sh track"

    For Help, Use:
        "[TFLOW_DIR]/tflow.sh run -h"
        OR: "[TFLOW_DIR]/tflow.sh run --help"


 --- Design ---
The TFLOW pipeline is designed with several key features in mind:
    Easy accessability of assembly utilities
    A smooth "Flow" of input/output data from one tool to the next
    Automated analysis of results
    Modular addition of new tools

    TFLOW is built on the Python2.7 language and thus requires Python2.7 as a dependency.
    Individual external components are required depending on the pipe utilized.
